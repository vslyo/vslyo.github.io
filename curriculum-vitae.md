### Research Interest
My current research focus is in the physics of information. The theory of quantum information sparked the idea that ‘information’ is physical just like matter and energy, and I am pursuing this idea.

I find it suitable as it involves elements of physics, mathematics and computer science and I am passionate about learning for its own sake. It is also interesting in that it comes up in physical systems ranging from quantum mechanical systems to statistical mechanical systems to black holes.

### Research Work
* #### Physics of Information
  * The major research theme I am working on is the physics of information. The quantum information theory perspective is that the “true” nature of information is quantum mechanical. However, there is a lot more to be done with this, including the use of statistical mechanics to study the properties of a large number of interacting information processors that leads to the behavior of information as we know it. These are some of the research ideas I am pursuing.
* #### Fuzzy Algebra
  * Working on developing a fuzzy algebra inspired evaluation system that aims to capture the fuzziness in human decision-making. Working on a mathematical base that would be suitable in achieving this goal; quantum information seems to be a promising avenue for developing this idea.
  * Later plans include developing a web-based interface that would improve usability.
* #### Big Five Personality Traits
 * Had worked on a system that uses speech data to infer personality traits of a person using the big five personality traits as a blueprint and an artificial neural network as the classifier under the Human Interaction and Artificial Intelligence group at the Department of Electronic Systems Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru.
