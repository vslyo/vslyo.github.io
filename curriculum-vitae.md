### Education
##### 2013 - 2017
Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad, Jharkhand, India  
Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering  
Minor in Engineering Physics  
CGPA: 8.46/10  

### Research Interest
I am currently learning about quantum information theory and how to interpret information physically. While there is a good understanding of information as a mathematical entity, how this conforms with our physical reality is an active area of research. The theory of quantum informaiton sparked the idea that 'information' is physical just like matter and energy and I aim to study this sort of characterisation of information and see if it leads to consistent ideas. My long term research interest lies in the merger of physics, mathematics and information theory.

### Research Work
* Working on developing a fuzzy algebra inspired evaluation system that aims to capture the fuzziness in human decision-making
  * Currently trying to come up with a mathematical base that would be suitable in achieving this goal; quantum information seems to be a promising avenue for developing this idea
  * Later plans include developing a web-based interface that would improve usability
* Working on a cryptosystem that uses the randomness of nature in order to achieve perfectly secure cryptography
  * Researching its possible links with quantum information
* Had worked on a system that uses speech data to infer personality traits of a person using the big five personality traits as a blueprint and an artificial neural network as the classifier under the Human Interaction and Artificial Intelligence group at the Department of Electronic Systems Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru

### Scholastic Achievements
* Secured all India 4th rank in the Joint Entrance Screening Test 2017 (Theoretical Physics)
