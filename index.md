The pleasure of learning more about our universe is my motivation. I love studying physics and mathematics and I wish to continue my life with this hedonistic goal in mind. I am currently pursuing the idea of understanding the realtion between the mathematical properties of information and how it is to be interpreted physically. This journey has pushed me to give up almost all the common sense notions that I previously held and is only getting more exciting!
