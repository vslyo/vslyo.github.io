### About Me
The pleasure of learning more about our universe is my motivation. I love studying physics and mathematics and am currently pursuing quantum information theory. I am interested in the relation between the mathematical and physical characteristics of information. This journey has pushed me to give up on much of my intuition and only keeps getting more exciting!
