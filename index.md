### Who am I?
I'm currently a doctoral student in physics. If I had to use one label to highlight my research focus it would be: physics of information. For my masters and currently in my doctoral studies, the main theme of my research has been "quantum and information": looking at quantum mechanics from an information theory perspective. Having started off in quantum foundations and quantum computing I have also lately been working on the connection between quantum mechanics and special relativity.

I am a member of the [information field theory group](https://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/109183/Information-Field-Theory) at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics, where along with the work on quantum mechanics, I have also been working on radio interferometric imaging. Additionally, I have spent a major fraction of my doctoral studies (and part of my masters) helping out with the lectures on [information field theory](https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~ensslin/lectures/lectures.html).

I am interested in most things with a flavour of physics, mathematics, or philosophy. Here are some of my latest work,
* Correlation as a Resource: the state of the environmentn (correlation-poster.pdf)
