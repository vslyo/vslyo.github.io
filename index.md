The pleasure of learning more about our universe is my motivation. I love studying physics and mathematics and I wish to continue my life with this hedonistic goal in mind. I am currently pursuing quantum information theory and am interested in the relation between the mathematical and physical characteritics of information. This journey has pushed me to give up on much of my intuition regarding information and only keeps getting more exciting!
