**Research Interest:** I am currently learning about quantum information theory and how to interpret information physically. While there is a pretty good understanding of information as a mathematical entity, how this conforms with our physical reality is an active area of research. The theory of quantum informaiton sparked the idea that 'information' is physical just like matter and energy and I aim to study this sort of characterisation of information and see if it leads to consistent ideas of nature. [Here](./about) is a somewhat lenghtier description of the same.
