### About Me
The pleasure of learning more about the universe is my motivation. I love thinking science and am currently exploring the physics of information. I am interested in the relation between the mathematical and physical characteristics of information. This journey has had many a plot twist, forcing me to give up on much of my intuition, and only keeps getting more exciting!
