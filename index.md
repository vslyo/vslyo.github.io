### , who is?
I'm currently a doctoral student. If I had to use one label for my research focus it would be: the physics of information. For my masters and currently in my doctoral studies the main theme has been quantum and information, looking at quantum mechanics from an information theory perspective. Starting off in quantum foundations and quantum computing, it has lately also touched upon the connection between quantum mechanics and relativity. On the other hand I am a member of the information theory group at MPA and my focus there has been on radio interferometric imaging. I have spend a lot of time teaching the course on information theory, so this has also been an integral part of my docotoral studies.
