### The Physics of Information
My current research interest is in the physics of information. The physical nature of information is what I think about most. Almost everything I work on seems to somehow relate to the physics of information. Below are some of my work on this area:
* [Knowledge in Quantum Mechanics](quantum-knowledge.pdf) - explores the concept of Knowledge from a quantum perspective
* [Quantum Nature of Classical Information](quantum-nature.pdf) - originally submitted for a course project requirement, this paper explores how classical information could be interpretted quantum mechanically
* [Newcomb's Problem and Entanglement](quantum-newcomb.pdf) - explores Newcomb's Problem from a quantum perspective. This was also submitted for a course
* [Interaction Free Measurement](interaction-free.pdf) - submitted for a seminar
* [Generalised Measurement](generalised-measurement.pdf)
* [Quantum Mechanics from an Information Theory Perspective](qm-it.pdf) - exploring quantum mechanics starting from the principle of information conservation

### Slider
Slider is an attempt at a fuzzy logic based evaluation system. This is a work in progress.
* [Slider](slider.pdf) - is a detailing of the ideas that inspired slider.

### Miscellanea
* [Twenty Four](twenty-four.pdf)
* [Integrality of the Multinomial Coefficients](multinomial-integrality.pdf)
* [Compositional Periodicity](compositional-periodicity.pdf)
* [Do things really exist?](things-exist.pdf)
* [Transcendence of Newton's Laws](newtonian-transcendence.pdf)
