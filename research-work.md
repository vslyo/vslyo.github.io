### The Physics of Information
My current research interest is in the physics of information.
#### Quantum and Information
* [Quantum Measurement and Objective Classical Reality](https://www.mdpi.com/2673-9984/9/1/16)
* [Is Fuchs Wigner's friend?](fuchs.pdf) - explores Wigner's paradox.
* [Measurement in a Unitary World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03829) - is a unitary formulation of quantum measurements.
* [Quantum Mechanics from an Information Theory Perspective](qm-it.pdf) - exploring quantum mechanics starting from the principle of information conservation.
* [Generalised Measurement](generalised-measurement.pdf)
* [Interaction Free Measurement](interaction-free.pdf) - submitted for a seminar.
* [Knowledge in Quantum Mechanics](quantum-knowledge.pdf) - explores the concept of Knowledge from a quantum perspective.
* [Newcomb's Problem and Entanglement](quantum-newcomb.pdf) - explores Newcomb's Problem from a quantum perspective, submitted for a course.
* [Quantum Nature of Classical Information](quantum-nature.pdf) - originally submitted for a course project requirement, this paper explores how classical information could be interpretted quantum mechanically.

### Slider
Slider is an attempt at a fuzzy logic based evaluation system. This is a work in progress.
* [Slider](slider.pdf) - is a detailing of the ideas that inspired slider.

### Miscellanea
