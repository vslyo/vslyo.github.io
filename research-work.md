## Physics of Information
Information is physical. What limits do the laws of physics impose on the information? 

#### Quantum and Information
Lately, my work has been on quantum foundations and moving towards quantum foundational issues intersecting with special relativity. The work I've been doing over the years:
* [Correlation as a Resource](correlation-poster.pdf): Quantum measurment involves the environment; assuming unitary quantum mechanics and some other natural statement constrians the initial state of the environment that allows for successful measurmeent. Also available as a [talk handout](correlation-talk.pdf).
* [When Everett observes Greenberger, Horne, and Zeilinger meet Wigner's friend](everett-ghz-poster.pdf): Can quantum mechanics and special relativity coexist in the context of the Wigner friend thought experiment? A [recent paradox](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02442).
* [Born Rule in Unitary Quantum Mechanics](born-rule-poster.pdf): A derivation of the Born rule following [Zurek's work](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0405161).
* [Quantum Measurement and Objective Classical Reality](https://www.mdpi.com/2673-9984/9/1/16): A precursor to the work on correlation as a resource. An explicit unitary quantum measurment procedure is developed. The backbone for this work and more details can be found in our earlier work: [Measurement in a Unitary World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03829).
* [Is Fuchs Wigner's friend?](fuchs.pdf): Or an analysis of Wigner’s Friend scenarios in the context of QBism, a comparison to the Relational Perspective and a glance at how an explanation could emerge out of the Many Worlds Interpretation.
* [Quantum Mechanics from an Information Theory Perspective](qm-it.pdf): My master thesis exploring quantum mechanics starting from the principle of information conservation.
* [Interaction Free Measurement](interaction-free.pdf): Not only can the state of a system be measured without interacting with it, but using quantum mechanics it can be done almost certainly with almost no
chance of destroying the state!
* [Knowledge in Quantum Mechanics](quantum-knowledge.pdf): Can quantum mechanics explain the concept of knowledge?
* [Quantum Nature of Classical Information](quantum-nature.pdf): Originally submitted for a course project requirement, this paper explores how classical information could be interpretted quantum mechanically.

#### Information Field Theory
The other part of my doctoral studies involves work on information field theory and specifically radio interferometric imaging.

#### Memes
* [Memegenesis](memegenesis.pdf): Can memes be modelled in physics? As a bonus, the answers to all questions of the universe: [Twenty Four](twenty-four.pdf).
* [Cosmic Rays and US Presidential Memes](cosmic-rays-memes.pdf) Inferring the dankness field of US presidential memes, joint work with Andrés Ramirez⁩.
