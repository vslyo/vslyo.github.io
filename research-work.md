### The Physics of Information
My current research interest is in the physics of information. The physical nature of information is what I think about most. Almost everything I work on seems to somehow connect to the physics of information. Below are some of my work on this area:
1. [Quantum Nature of Classical Information](quantum_nature.pdf) - Originally submitted for a course project requirement, this paper explores how classical information could be interpretted quantum mechanically.
2. [Newcomb's Problem and Entanglement](quantum_newcomb.pdf) - explores Newcomb's Problem from a quantum perspective. This was also submitted for a course.

### Slider
Slider is an attempt at a fuzzy logic based evaluation system. This is a work in progress.
1. [Slider](slider-2.pdf) - is a detailing of the ideas that inspired slider.

### Miscellanea
1. [Twenty Four](twenty_four.pdf)
2. [Integrality of the Multinomial Coefficients](multinomial-integrality.pdf)
