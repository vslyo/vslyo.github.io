### The Physics of Information
My current research interest is in the physics of information. The physical nature of information is what I think about most. Almost everything I work on seems to somehow relate to the physics of information. Below are some of my work on this area:
* [Knowledge in Quantum Mechanics](quantum_knowledge.pdf) - explores the concept of Knowledge from a quantum perspective.
* [Quantum Nature of Classical Information](quantum_nature.pdf) - originally submitted for a course project requirement, this paper explores how classical information could be interpretted quantum mechanically.
* [Newcomb's Problem and Entanglement](quantum_newcomb.pdf) - explores Newcomb's Problem from a quantum perspective. This was also submitted for a course.
* [Interaction Free Measurement](interaction_free.pdf) - submitted for a seminar.

### Slider
Slider is an attempt at a fuzzy logic based evaluation system. This is a work in progress.
* [Slider](slider.pdf) - is a detailing of the ideas that inspired slider.

### Miscellanea
* [Twenty Four](twenty_four.pdf)
* [Integrality of the Multinomial Coefficients](multinomial_integrality.pdf)
* [Compositional Periodicity](compositional_periodicity.pdf)
* [Do things really exist?](things_exist.pdf)
* [Transcendence of Newton's Laws](newtonian_transcendence.pdf)
* [Newcomb's Problem and an argument for 1-boxing](newcomb.pdf)
* [Expressions for Quantum Relative Entropy](relative_entropy_expressions.pdf)
