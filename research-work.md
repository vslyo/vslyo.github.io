### Slider
Slider is an attempt at a fuzzy logic based evaluation system. I am currently working on coming up with a mathematical base for slider. The linked paper describes some of my ideas about how qubits could be used to represent sliders. This is a work in progress and is, consequently, not all that refined. [Here](vslyo.github.io/Slider_(2).pdf) is a link to the paper.
