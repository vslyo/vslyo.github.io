#### Hobbies
I have an active interest in music, working on a few compositions but haven't done anything solid yet. My tastes range from classical to jazz to rock to folk, I am currently in an exploratory phase.

What I most enjoy reading is mystery fiction. I watch a bunch of tv. I am hoping to travel when I get a chance. Other than that I mostly seek out memes.
