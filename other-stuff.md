#### Hobbies
I have an active interest in music, working on a few compositions but haven't done anything solid yet. My tastes range from classical to jazz to rock to folk, I am currently in an exploratory phase.

I enjoy reading, mostly mystery fiction (but never really find the time). I watch a bunch of tv (somehow find time for this). I enjoy travel but haven't done anything solid. Other than that I mostly seek out memes.
